## 1. Ingredients

- **Main**: 1 whole chicken (cut into pieces, approx 1kg), 2-3 large potatoes, 1/2 carrot, 1 onion, 1 leek (or green onions), 2 green chili peppers.
- **Sauce base**: 2 tbsp Gochujang (red chili paste), 3 tbsp Gochugaru (red chili flakes), 5 tbsp Soy sauce, 2 tbsp Sugar, 1 tbsp Corn syrup (or honey), 1 tbsp Minced garlic, 1/2 tsp Minced ginger, a pinch of Black pepper, 500ml Water.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1) Prep and Blanch the Chicken
Rinse the chicken thoroughly. Blanch the chicken pieces in boiling water for 3-5 minutes (add a splash of cooking wine or ginger to remove gamey odors). Drain and rinse with cold water.

### 2) Prepare the Vegetables
Cut potatoes and carrots into large bite-sized chunks. Slice the onion and chop the leeks and chili peppers diagonally.

### 3) Pre-seasoning with Sugar
Place the blanched chicken in a pot with 500ml of water. Add **2 tbsp of sugar** first and bring to a boil. This helps the flavors penetrate the meat better and acts as a tenderizer.

### 4) Simmering with Sauce
Add the prepared sauce ingredients, potatoes, and carrots. Simmer on medium heat for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens and the chicken is fully cooked.

### 5) Final Touch
Add the sliced onion, leeks, and chili peppers. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Finish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.

## Pro Tips
- Leave some sauce at the end to make "Bokkeumbap" (fried rice) with the remaining gravy.
- For a deeper umami flavor, use kelp or anchovy broth instead of plain water.
